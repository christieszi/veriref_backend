Basic Tests

1," Yes, the statement ""Monica went for a walk"" is true if the initial statement ""Monica went for a walk"" is true. The two statements are identical, so if one is true, the other is also true.",True
2," The statement 'Sam loves running' suggests a strong affection or passion for running. While it's reasonable to assume that someone who loves an activity also enjoys it, the terms ""loves"" and ""enjoys"" are not exactly interchangeable.

""Loves"" implies a deeper, more profound emotional connection and commitment to the activity, whereas ""enjoys"" suggests a pleasant or satisfying experience.

Therefore, while it's likely that 'Sam enjoys running' is true based on the information given, it is not a definitive conclusion without additional context. The enjoyment could be derivatively implied from the love for the activity, but the precise nature of Sam's feelings would need to be clarified to state it with certainty.",True 
3," No, the statement ""Marina did not eat ice-cream"" is not true based on the given information ""Marina ate ice-cream."" The two statements are contradictions of each other.",False
4," No, the statement ""Max hates hockey"" is not necessarily true based on the information given, ""Max likes hockey."" These two statements are contradictory; they express opposite opinions about Max's feelings toward hockey. If Max likes hockey, it does not imply that Max hates hockey.",False
5," Yes, the sentence ""Yesterday, it was rainy"" is true based on the statement ""It was raining yesterday."" Both sentences convey the same information: that precipitation was occurring yesterday. The adjective ""rainy"" describes a state or condition of it raining, so the two statements are effectively equivalent.",True
6," No, the statement ""A week ago the weather was sunny and really warm"" is not true based on the information given. The original statement ""It was extremely cold and rainy a week ago"" provides conflicting information. Therefore, the second statement contradicts the first.",False
7," Yes, the statement ""Daniel got ill, so he did not go to classes"" is essentially the same as ""Daniel missed the school because he caught a cold."" Both statements convey that Daniel's illness (catching a cold) was the reason he did not attend school.",True 
8," No, the given statement does not provide information about Ben's health. The only reason given for Ben not going to New York is that his flight was cancelled. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that Ben got ill or that he could not go to New York due to illness.",False
9," Yes, the statement ""I bought a laptop for less than 1000£"" is true. Since your new laptop costs 999£, which is less than 1000£, the statement accurately reflects the price of your laptop.",True 
10," The statement ""There was a car accident next to my house"" could be true, but it depends on the specific context and details of the situation. If you are saying that a car accident indeed occurred in close proximity to your house, then the statement would be true. If the statement is derived from a hypothetical scenario or is false in reality, then it would not be true. Without additional context or verification, it's impossible to definitively determine the truthfulness of the statement.",True
11," No, the statement ""The area where I live is dangerous"" is not true based on the given information ""I live in a very safe street."" If a street is very safe, it implies that the area is not dangerous.",False
12," The statement ""My friend went to music festival yesterday"" is grammatically incorrect because it is missing an article before ""music festival."" It should be ""My friend went to **a** music festival yesterday"" or ""My friend went to **the** music festival yesterday,"" depending on the context.

However, if we ignore the grammatical error and focus on the information provided, the statement ""My friend went to music festival yesterday"" is true according to the original sentence ""My friend went to music festival yesterday."" Both sentences convey the same information about your friend attending a music festival the previous day.",True

14," No, the statement ""Serena has won 25 Grand Slam singles"" is not true. According to the information provided, Serena Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles.",False
15," No, the statement ""Jesse Owens was born in Cleveland, Ohio"" is not true. According to the provided information, Jesse Owens was born in Oakville, Alabama, on September 12, 1913, and his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, when he was nine years old.",False
16," Yes, the statement ""Mingora was a popular among tourists"" is true based on the information provided. The passage states that Malala's hometown of Mingora was a ""tourist hotspot"" during her early childhood.",True
17," No, the statement ""Malala wrote a book anonymously when she was 11 years old"" is not true based on the provided information. The passage mentions that Malala started writing an anonymous blog under the name Gul Makai, not a book. Also, it does not specify the age at which she started the blog, though it implies she was younger when she began it and became more publicly known later on. There is no mention of her writing a book at age 11, only that her experiences and activism led to her winning several peace awards and attending prestigious events.",False
18," Yes, the statement ""Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17 years old"" is true according to the provided text. It specifically states that Malala was the youngest person in the world to receive the Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 17.",True
19," Yes, the statement ""Malala’s mother’s name is Toor Pekai Yousafzai"" is true. The given text explicitly states, ""Malala calls her mother, Toor Pekai Yousafzai, ‘brave and courageous’..."" Therefore, the name of Malala's mother is indeed Toor Pekai Yousafzai.",True

Harder Multi Sentence Ipout

20," Yes, the statement is true. At the beginning of the story, the Lion and the Tiger are bored because they are not providing any real protection to Princess Ozma. They are mainly ornamental as the people of Oz are very well-behaved, and there are no disturbances that need their intervention. The Lion explicitly expresses this boredom when he says, ""I’m getting tired of this job. No one is afraid of us and no one pays any attention to us."" Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the feelings of the Lion and the Tiger as depicted in the story.",True
21," Yes, the statement ""Lion and the Tiger bored at the beginning of the story because nobody wants to hurt Ozma"" is true. The text explicitly states that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger are mainly ornamental and that no one in Oz is seldom naughty, which makes their job as guardians mostly useless and causes them to be bored.",True
22," No, the statement is not entirely true. While the Tiger mentions that it is hungry, the Tiger clarifies that it wants to eat ""fat babies,"" not just more food in general. The Tiger and Lion decide to act on their plan to scare the people of Oz and prove their power, not because they are hungry for more food but because they are bored with their current job and want to cause a sensation. So, the plan is not primarily motivated by a need for more food.",False
23," No, the text does not support the statement ""Siddhartha has raised his son since infancy."" The text implies that Siddhartha only recently met his son, likely for the first time, when the boy attended his mother's funeral. The text describes the boy as ""gloomy and shy,"" not recognizing Siddhartha as his father, and being a ""pampered boy... accustomed to finer food, to a soft bed."" These details suggest that the boy has been raised in a different environment and has not been with Siddhartha from infancy.",False
24," Yes, the passage indeed suggests that the boy grew up in a wealthy home with servants. It states:

""Slowly, he also saw and understood that the eleven-year-old was a pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he had grown up in the habits of rich people, accustomed to finer food, to a soft bed, accustomed to giving orders to servants.""

This description indicates that the boy was raised in a luxurious environment with servants.",True
25," Yes, the following statement is true: ""Siddhartha is understanding and kind to his son."" Throughout the passage, it is clear that Siddhartha:

1. **Understands** his son's feelings and situation: He realizes that his son does not know or love him like a father, that he is mourning the loss of his mother, and that he is not used to a simple life.

2. **Is patient** with his son: He does not force his son to do anything, instead letting him grieve and adjust at his own pace.

3. **Is kind** to his son: He spares him, honors his mourning, does many chores for him, and always picks the best piece of the meal for him.

4. **Loves** his son: Despite the difficulties and struggles, Siddhartha loves his son and is willing to bear the suffering and",True
26," Yes, the statement ""Asian carp is an unpopular menu item since it is hard to prepare because of all the little bones"" is true based on the provided text. The passage states that ""They also have lots of tiny bones in their meat, which makes them difficult to prepare. Asian carp is not a popular delicacy."" This indicates that Asian carp is not a preferred food choice due to the challenges in preparing it because of the numerous small bones, contributing to its unpopularity as a menu item.",True
27," The text states that ""Asian carp is not a popular delicacy,"" but it does not specifically mention that it is unpopular because it is ""fattening."" Instead, the text mentions two other reasons why Asian carp is not popular:

1. **Algal toxins**: Asian carp eat large amounts of plankton and algae, some of which can be toxic. These toxins accumulate in their systems, making them hazardous to eat for humans.

2. **Tiny bones**: The text mentions that Asian carp have lots of tiny bones in their meat, which makes them difficult to prepare and not a popular choice in cuisine.

So, based on the provided text, we cannot confirm that Asian carp is unpopular because it is a very fattening fish.",False
26," Yes, the statement ""Asian carp is an unpopular menu item because some of them are toxic and unsafe to eat"" is true. According to the text, Asian carp feed on plankton and algae, some of which are toxin-laden. The fish can accumulate these toxins in their systems, making them unsafe for human consumption. Additionally, Asian carp have lots of tiny bones, which make them difficult to prepare and less appealing as a menu item.",True
27," No, the passage does not state that Asian carp is an unpopular menu item because it is very fattening. Instead, it lists two reasons why Asian carp is not a popular delicacy:

1. **Algal toxins**: ""Some Asian carp are hazardous to eat because they have so many algal toxins in their systems.""
2. **Tiny bones**: ""They also have lots of tiny bones in their meat, which makes them difficult to prepare.""

The passage does not mention that the fish is particularly fattening.",False
28," Yes, the statement 'According to the text, one species of Asian carp is the silver carp' is true. The text explicitly mentions the silver carp as one of the species of Asian carp, noting that it can grow to be 100 pounds and is also known as 'flying carp' due to its tendency to jump when frightened.",False
29," Yes, it is true that it is argued Asian carp could disrupt the ecosystem in Lake Michigan. The text you provided discusses the potential impact of Asian carp on the ecosystem if they were to enter the Great Lakes, including Lake Michigan. Key points in the text include:

1. **Food Chain Disruption**: Asian carp are large bottom-feeding fish that consume plankton and algae. If they enter Lake Michigan, they could outcompete native bottom-feeders, affecting the entire food chain, including larger predatory fish like salmon.

2. **Ecological Imbalance**: The introduction of a species that is not native to the waters could disrupt the delicate balance that has evolved over millions of years in the Great Lakes ecosystem.

3. **Invasive Species History**: The text mentions that Asian carp have disrupted ecosystems in other areas where they have been introduced, suggesting",True
30," Based on the provided text, it is not true that a waterskier is the person most threatened by silver carp in a local water source. The text mentions a specific incident where a woman jetskier was injured in 2003. While waterskiers and other boaters are indeed at risk due to silver carp jumping out of the water when frightened by boat motors, the text does not compare the threat to waterskiers with the threat to other groups. It does, however, emphasize the broader ecological and economic impacts of Asian carp on local waters and ecosystems, suggesting that the overall threat might be more significant than the risk to individual waterskiers.",True
30," No, the statement ""A beachgoer is the person who is most threatened by silver carp in a local water source"" is not accurate based on the provided text. The text specifically mentions that water skiers and boaters are most threatened by Asian carp, particularly the silver carp, due to their tendency to jump out of the water when startled by boat motors. This poses a serious threat to individuals participating in water sports because they can be struck by these large, jumping fish. Beachgoers, who tend to remain on the shore or in shallow water, are not as likely to encounter this specific threat.",True
31," No, the statement ""Silver carp can jump up to twenty feet in the air"" is not true. The text you provided states: ""They can jump up to ten feet in the air."" therefore, the correct information is that silver carp can jump up to ten feet in the air, not twenty.",False
32," Yes, the statement ""Silver carp can grow to be 100 lbs."" is true. The text explicitly states: ""One species, the silver carp, can grow to be 100 pounds.""",True
34," Yes, the statement ""Silver carp are also known as 'flying carp'"" is true. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are known for their tendency to jump out of the water when frightened, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet. This behavior has led to the nickname ""flying carp.""",True
33," Yes, the statement ""Silver carp are also known as 'flying carp'"" is true. The silver carp has a tendency to jump out of the water when startled or disturbed, often leaping up to ten feet in the air. This distinctive behavior has earned them the nickname ""flying carp.""",True
35," Yes, the statement ""Silver carp are also known as 'flying carp'"" is true. The silver carp is known for its ability to leap out of the water, sometimes up to ten feet in the air, when startled by the sound of boat motors. This behavior has earned them the nickname ""flying carp.""",True
36," Yes, the statement is true. According to the text provided, ""In 2007 the U.S. Department of the Interior declared all silver carp to be an injurious species."" This declaration by the U.S. government highlights their concerns about the impact of silver carp on local ecosystems and waterways.",True
37," Based on the passage, the author does not explicitly state that they believe it would be best for the fishing industry if the canal were closed permanently. Instead, the author presents the idea that some people think the Great Lakes should be cut off from the Mississippi River, and mentions legal actions taken by the Michigan Attorney General and other entities in support of this idea. The author also notes the value of the canal as a shipping conduit and that the courts have been persuaded by this value thus far. Therefore, the author does not express a clear personal belief on whether closing the canal permanently would be the best course of action for the fishing industry.",True
38," Based on the provided text, it is not accurate to say that ""The Great Lake states agree fully on a solution to the Asian carp problem."" The text mentions that legal actions have been taken by different parties, including the Michigan Attorney General and the Ontario government, indicating that there is not a unified agreement among all Great Lake states on the best solution. The mention of multiple lawsuits suggests divergent views on how to handle the problem. While there is shared concern about the threat posed by Asian carp, there is no clear consensus on a single approach to resolve the issue.",False

39," The statement ""Bob got the highest score in the class"" does not necessarily imply that ""Bob got an A."" The highest score in the class could still represent a grade other than A, depending on the grading scale and how the scores are distributed. For instance, if the class uses a scale where the highest grade is A+, or if the top scores are all converging around B+ or B, the highest score might not correspond to an A. Therefore, without additional context or information about the grading scale, we cannot definitively conclude that Bob got an A based solely on the information given.",False/Cannot Say
40," The statement ""Bob passed the test"" can be inferred to be true based on the given information. Here's the reasoning:

1. **""Nobody failed the test""**: This implies that every student, including Bob, achieved a passing score.
2. **""Bob got the highest score in the class""**: This further supports that Bob, at a minimum, passed the test since he had the highest score.

Given these two pieces of information, it's logical to conclude that Bob did indeed pass the test.",True
41," The statement ""Amelia does not have any brothers"" does not provide any information about whether Amelia has any sisters. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the statement ""Amelia got a sister"" is true or false based on the given information. The first statement is about siblings in general, but it does not exclude the possibility of Amelia having sisters.",False/Cannot Say
42," Let's carefully analyze the information provided:

1. ""Amelia has 2 siblings.""
2. ""Amelia does not have any brothers.""

From the first statement, we know that Amelia has two siblings in total. From the second statement, we know that neither of these siblings is male. Therefore, both of Amelia's siblings must be female.

So, the statement ""Amelia has 2 sisters"" is true based on the given information.",True
43," Based on the information provided, it is not true that 'Olly is 2 years old'. The first article states that Olly is 2 years old, but the second article contradicts this by stating that Olly is 3 years old. Therefore, there is no definitive answer as to Olly's age, and we cannot confirm that 'Olly is 2 years old' is accurate.",False/Cannot Say
44," False. The information given is contradictory. We don't have enough reliable information to definitively say Olly is 3 years old or 2 years old. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine Olly's age.",False/Cannot Say
45," Yes, the statement ""We cannot say how old Olly is"" is true based on the information provided. The articles give conflicting information about Olly's age, with one stating that Olly is 2 years old and the other stating that Olly is 3 years old. Therefore, without additional information to resolve the discrepancy, it is not possible to determine Olly's exact age.",True
46," The statement 'The scientists developed a new species of apples that have a blue colour. The same laboratory developed a species of oranges that have a bright green colour' does not imply that 'Scientists managed to create blue apples, green oranges, and they are about to produce blue oranges.'

The original statement only tells us about the existence of blue apples and green oranges. It does not provide any information about the scientists' plans or future intentions related to creating blue oranges. Therefore, the claim that they are ""about to produce blue oranges"" cannot be confirmed based on the given information.",False
47," The statement ""2000000£ will be invested in the development of London transport"" is not necessarily true based on the given information ""Over 1000000£ will be invested in public transport of London.""

The statement ""Over 1000000£"" only tells us that the amount is more than 1,000,000£ but does not specify the exact amount. It could be 1,000,001£, 1,500,000£, or any amount above 1,000,000£. Without further information, we cannot conclude that the exact amount is 2,000,000£.",False
48," No, the given statement ""We can surely say that the new medication is effective in treating cancer"" is not true based on the information provided.

The original statement mentions that the medication could potentially be useful for treating cancer and that the results are promising. However, it also emphasizes that the results are not final and that further medical trials, especially for analyzing long-term side effects, need to be conducted. This implies that while there is preliminary evidence suggesting the medication's potential, its effectiveness in treating cancer is not yet certain or definitively proven. Thus, it would be premature to make a definitive statement about the medication's efficacy until more thorough and comprehensive trials are completed.",False
49," No, the statement ""We can surely say that the new medication does not have any side effects"" is not true based on the information provided. The original passage explicitly states that more medical trials need to be conducted, especially to analyze long-term side effects. This implies that the potential side effects of the medication have not yet been fully determined. Therefore, it is premature to make a definitive statement about the absence of side effects. The current results are described as promising, but further research is needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the medication over the long term.",False
50," No, the statement ""We do not know how effective is the new medication for treating cancer, but we know for sure that it has no side effects"" is not true based on the given information.

The passage states that ""the results are not final, and more medical trials need to be conducted, especially to analyze long-term side effects."" This indicates that the long-term side effects of the new medication are not yet fully known. Therefore, it is incorrect to say ""we know for sure that it has no side effects"" without additional long-term trial data.

The passage also mentions that the current results look promising but do not provide definitive information on the medication's effectiveness or side effects.",False
51," No, the statement ""The new medication is very effective for cancer treatment, but more studies of potential side effects are needed"" is not fully consistent with or supported by the original passage.

While the original passage does indicate that the newly developed medication could potentially be useful for treating cancer and that the current results look promising, it also emphasizes that the results are not final and more medical trials are needed. Moreover, it specifically points out the need for additional trials to analyze long-term side effects.

The original passage is cautious and acknowledges the preliminary nature of the research, whereas the statement ""The new medication is very effective for cancer treatment"" implies a higher level of certainty and efficacy that is not supported by the original text. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies and misrepresents the nuanced findings discussed in the original passage.",False
52," The statement provided does not confirm that the new medication has cured cancer in any case. It only suggests that preliminary research indicates potential usefulness for treating cancer. The results are not final, and further medical trials are needed, especially to analyze long-term side effects, but the current results look promising. This does not necessarily mean that there is a case where the medication has definitively cured cancer.",False
53," Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that the newly developed medication was tested on animals. The text mentions ""preliminary research"" and the need for ""more medical trials,"" but it does not specify the type of trials conducted so far or the subjects involved (e.g., animals or humans). Therefore, the statement ""The new medication was tested on animals, and now it needs to be tested on humans"" cannot be confirmed as true from the provided information. It is possible that further clarification or additional details would be needed to determine the truth of that statement.",False
54," Yes, the statement ""80% of respondents reported improved sleep quality"" is true, given the information provided. If 8 out of 10 respondents noticed an improvement in sleep quality after taking the newly developed medication, then 80% of the respondents reported improved sleep quality.",True
55," Yes, the two statements are essentially saying the same thing. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""8 out of 10 respondents noticed an improvement in sleep quality after taking the newly developed medication.""
   - This means that 80% of the respondents reported an improvement in their sleep quality.

2. ""80% of respondents said that they started to sleep better after using the new medication.""
   - This also means that 80% of the respondents saw an improvement in their sleep quality.

Both statements are communicating the same percentage of respondents who experienced a positive change in their sleep quality due to the new medication. Therefore, the conclusion is true.",True
56," To determine if the statement ""60% of respondents reported improved sleep quality"" is true, we need to establish the relationship between the proportion and the percentage.

Given:
- 8 out of 10 respondents noticed improvement in sleep quality.

This means:
- The proportion of respondents who noticed improvement is \( \frac{8}{10} \).

To convert this proportion to a percentage:
1. Understand that a proportion of \( \frac{8}{10} \) is equivalent to \( 0.8 \).
2. To find the percentage, multiply the proportion by 100:
   \[
   0.8 \times 100 = 80\%
   \]

Therefore, the statement ""80% of respondents reported improved sleep quality"" is true. The statement ""60% of respondents reported improved sleep quality"" is not",True
57," To determine if the statement ""every one in two respondents said that they started to sleep better after using the new medication"" is true, we need to compare it with the given information.

The given information is ""8 out of 10 respondents noticed improvement in sleep quality after taking the newly developed medication.""

This means that 80% of respondents said they noticed an improvement in sleep quality.

The statement ""every one in two respondents"" is another way of saying ""50% of respondents.""

Since 80% is greater than 50%, the statement ""every one in two respondents said that they started to sleep better after using the new medication"" is true based on the given information.",True

59," Yes, the statement ""Kids are not into sweets"" is true based on the given information ""Kids do not like sweets."" Both phrases convey the same meaning, which is that children, in general, do not have an interest or preference for sweets. Therefore, they can be considered equivalent in their intended meaning.",True
60," Based on the statement 'New studies show that eating excess amount of sugar does not affect weight gain', the following statement: 'Eating a lot of sugar is directly related to weight gain' is false (or not true).

The initial statement explicitly claims that eating too much sugar does not influence weight gain according to new studies, which directly contradicts the idea that a high sugar intake is directly related to weight gain. Therefore, the second statement is incorrect in light of the provided information.",False/Might need checking
61," The statement ""The latest discoveries show that one cannot get addicted to caffeine"" is not necessarily true based on the given premise ""Scientific community admitted that previous studies were not correct, and that actually caffeine is not addictive."" Here's why:

1. **Current vs. Previous Studies**: The statement ""previous studies were not correct"" implies that there were flaws or inaccuracies in those studies, not that all studies on caffeine addiction up to that point were incorrect.

2. **Nuanced Understanding**: The scientific community's admission might involve a more nuanced understanding of caffeine's effects. For instance, they might be acknowledging that caffeine doesn't meet the criteria for classic addictive substances like alcohol or nicotine, but it can still cause physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms in some individuals.

3. **Ongoing Research**: The",True/Might need checking
62," Yes, the statement ""It was recorded that at least one human had 210 bones"" is true. The original statement ""A man with 210 bones was admitted to hospital"" clearly indicates that there is at least one human who was admitted to the hospital with 210 bones. This satisfies the condition stated in the second statement.",True 
63," No, the statement ""Humans use only 10%-15% of their brain"" is not true. This misconception is prevalent in popular culture, but it has been debunked by neuroscience. Modern neuroscience confirms that humans use virtually every part of their brain, even if not all at the same time. Different brain regions are active at different times, depending on the tasks being performed. Brain imaging technologies such as PET scans and fMRI have shown that a great deal of the brain is active during many everyday tasks. The myth likely arises from misinterpretations of earlier research, but the idea that humans only use a small fraction of their brain has no scientific basis.",False
65," No, the statement ""Goldfish have a 3-second memory"" is not true. The misconception likely originates from an old study from 1995 that incorrectly concluded goldfish only have a 3-second memory span. This study has since been debunked, and it is now widely accepted that goldfish can remember information for at least several days, if not longer, depending on the context and complexity of the task.",False
66," No, the statement ""Bulls are irritated by red colour"" is not true. According to the given information, ""Bulls react to the movement, not to red colour as many people believe."" This means that bulls' reactions are primarily triggered by movement, indicating they are more sensitive to actions or motion rather than the color red itself. The misconception that bulls are provoked by the color red likely arises from the use of red capes in bullfighting, but the bull is actually reacting to the movement of the cape rather than its color.",False
67," No, the statement ""Vikings wore horned helmets"" is not true. Based on the given information, ""There is no historical evidence that Vikings wore helmets with horns,"" it is inaccurate to assert that Vikings wore horned helmets. The lack of historical evidence suggests that this popular myth is not grounded in factual history.",False
68," The statement ""Humans have only 5 senses: taste, hearing, sight, smell, touch"" is not entirely true. While taste, hearing, sight, smell, and touch are the traditional five senses, humans also have other senses that are not included in this list. These additional senses include the sense of balance (vestibular system) and the sense of temperature, as well as the ability to sense pain, proprioception (knowing the position and movement of the body), and others. Therefore, humans possess more than just the traditional five senses.",False
69," Yes, the statement ""Skin and hair stop growing after death"" is true. After a person dies, all physical processes in the body cease, including the growth of hair and nails. The apparent growth of hair and nails after death is an illusion caused by the dehydration of the skin. As the skin loses moisture and retracts, it exposes more of the hair shafts and nails, making them seem like they are growing. However, no new tissue is being created after death.",True 
70," Yes, the statement that ""the receptors for different tastes are spread across the tongue"" is true. The backdrop to this is that the assumption that there are specific taste zones on the tongue for different tastes (such as sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) is indeed false. Instead, taste buds that contain receptor cells sensitive to different tastes are distributed across the entire tongue.

So, to clarify:
- The old ""tongue map"" theory, which suggested specific areas for different tastes, is not accurate.
- Taste receptors for all tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami) are present throughout the tongue.

Therefore, the statement ""The receptors for different tastes are spread across the tongue"" aligns with current scientific understanding.",True
71," The statement ""Lightning never strikes the same place twice"" is a common myth, but it is not accurate in reality. Lightning can indeed strike the same place multiple times, as illustrated by the example of the Empire State Building. The famous skyscraper is struck by lightning on average 23 to 25 times per year, according to the National Weather Service. This demonstrates that tall structures, such as the Empire State Building, can attract multiple lightning strikes due to their height and prominence as a tall object in the environment.",False

79," Let's analyze the statement ""The museum closes at 5 PM"" in order to determine the truth of the statement ""The museum shuts its doors at 5 PM.""

1. **""The museum closes at 5 PM""**:

2. **""The museum shuts its doors at 5 PM""**:

While the two statements are related, they are not necessarily identical.

81," No, the two statements are not necessarily equivalent.

When you say, ""The train arrived 10 minutes late,"" you are indicating that the train reached its destination 10 minutes after its scheduled arrival time.

However, when you say, ""The train was delayed by 10 minutes,"" it implies that the train was held up for 10 minutes at some point during its journey. The delay could have occurred anywhere along the route, and it's not necessarily the case that the entire 10 minutes of delay caused the train to arrive 10 minutes late. The train could have been delayed by 10 minutes but still arrive a few minutes early or right on time if it made up time elsewhere during its journey.

So, while arriving 10 minutes late implies there was some sort of delay, it doesn’t necessarily mean the train was delayed by exactly 10 minutes throughout its journey.",True

2. **Most Recent Past**: It could also be understood to mean the same thing as your original statement, i.e., Alice visited the Grand Canyon during the most recent past summer.
