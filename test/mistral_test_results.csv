16," Yes, the statement that Mingora was a popular tourist hotspot in Malala's early childhood is correct. The Swat Valley, where Mingora is located, was known for its natural beauty and cultural attractions. It attracted many tourists before the security situation declined due to militant activities. Malala herself mentioned in her memoir, ""I Am Malala,"" that Swat was a peaceful place when she was a child, with lush green valleys, and was often visited by tourists from Pakistan and abroad. The valley held many festivals, including the popular Swat Festival, which contributed to its tourist appeal. However, the situation changed significantly after the rise of the Taliban, leading to increased violence and decreased tourism.",True
17," The statement that Malala wrote a book anonymously when she was 11 years old is not entirely correct. While it is true that Malala began to write an anonymous blog under the name Gul Makai at the age of 11 to speak out about the unequal treatment of girls in Pakistan, this blog was not a book. The blog posts were published online and attracted a significant audience, leading to increased attention and support for Malala's cause.

20," Based on the provided text, the statement is not entirely correct. At the beginning of the story, the Lion and the Tiger are not explicitly described as being bored. They are initially portrayed as ""solemn"" and keeping ""quiet"" until the Royal Audience is over. It is only later, after everyone has left the Throne Room, that the Cowardly Lion expresses his boredom and dissatisfaction with their job. So, the boredom is not highlighted at the beginning but rather emerges later in the narrative.",True
21," Yes, the statement is correct. The Lion and the Tiger are bored at the beginning of the story because nobody wants to hurt Ozma. They are aware that the people of Oz are generally very well-behaved and peaceful, so they feel that their presence as guardians is more for show than actual protection. This is why the Lion expresses a desire to leave the job, and the Tiger admits that they might as well be elsewhere since no one poses a threat to Ozma and they are often ignored.",True
22," No, the statement is not entirely correct. While it is true that the Hungry Tiger mentions being hungry and longing for specific food (fat babies), the primary motivation for their plan is not solely due to the need for more food. The Tiger expresses a desire to be feared and become more important, which aligns with the Lion's sentiment that they are underappreciated and bored with their current roles. The Lion brings up their formidable physical abilities and proposes using them to frighten the people of Oz. Therefore, the main reason behind their plan is a combination of their desire for attention, respect, and to prove their ferocity, rather than hunger alone.",False
23," No, the statement that Siddhartha has raised his son since infancy is not correct. The text explicitly states that Siddhartha's son was raised by his mother, Kamala, and had grown up not knowing his father. Here are the relevant parts:

- ""The boy had attended his mother's funeral; gloomy and shy, he had listened to Siddhartha, who greeted him as his son...""
- ""Siddhartha understood that his son did not know him, that he could not love him like a father.""
- ""He did many a chore for him, always picked the best piece of the meal for him. Slowly, he hoped to win him over, by friendly patience.""

These passages indicate that Siddhartha has not been his son's primary caregiver or father figure until recently, and that the boy has some difficulty accepting Siddharth",False
24," Yes, the statement that ""The boy grew up in a wealthy home with servants"" is correct. The passage mentions that the eleven-year-old boy was a ""pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he had grown up in the habits of rich people, accustomed to finer food, to a soft bed, accustomed to giving orders to servants."" This indicates that he was raised in a wealthy and privileged environment with servants catering to his needs.",True
25," Yes, the statement that Siddhartha is understanding and kind to his son is correct based on the passage. Here are several pieces of evidence from the text that support this:

1. **Patience and Acceptance**: Siddhartha understands that his son does not know him and cannot immediately love him as a father. He acknowledges that the boy is mourning and gives him the space to do so, honoring his mourning.

2. **Understanding of the Boy's Background**: Siddhartha recognizes that his son is accustomed to a life of luxury and comfort, and he understands that the boy cannot suddenly and willingly adapt to a life of poverty and hard work.

3. **Caring Actions**: Siddhartha performs many chores for his son and always gives him the best piece of the meal. He shows kindness and consideration by not forcing his son to do things he is not",True
26," Yes, the statement is correct. Asian carp are not typically a popular menu item due to several reasons, one of which is the numerous tiny bones they have, making them difficult to prepare. Other reasons include:

1. **Abundance of Algal Toxins**: Asian carp feed on plankton and algae, including toxic forms, which can accumulate in their system. These toxins can be harmful to humans if consumed.

2. **Muddy Taste**: Their diet also gives them a muddy or grassy taste, which is not appealing to many people.

3. **Threat of Invasiveness**: Even if someone wanted to eat them to help control their population, consuming them could potentially spread the species, as any remaining eggs or larvae could find their way into new water systems through human waste.

4. **Lack of Cultural Significance**: Unlike some other fish species",True
27," No, the statement that ""Asian carp is a very fattening fish, so it is an unpopular menu item"" is not correct. While it's true that Asian carp can grow to be quite large, the unpopularity of Asian carp as a menu item is primarily due to two other factors:

1. **Bones**: Asian carp have a multitude of small, thin bones which make them difficult and unpleasant to eat. This is often cited as the main reason why they are not popular among consumers.

2. **Toxins**: Asian carp can accumulate harmful algal toxins in their bodies, which can be passed on to humans who consume them. This makes them potentially hazardous to eat.

Their size (or ""fattening"" nature) and the challenges in preparing them due to numerous bones, along with potential health risks from toxins, contribute to their lack",False
26," Yes, the statement is correct. Asian carp are not a popular delicacy and are generally considered to be unsafe to eat for several reasons, one of which is their tendency to accumulate toxic algal toxins in their systems. Here are a few more reasons why they are not favored in the culinary world:

1. **Toxins**: Asian carp, particularly silver carp, can accumulate toxins produced by harmful algal blooms. These toxins can make the fish unsafe for human consumption.

2. **Small Bones**: Asian carp have many small bones, making them difficult to fillet and prepare. This makes them less popular among fish eaters and chefs.

3. **Lack of Flavor**: Compared to many other types of fish, Asian carp are often considered to have a lackluster flavor. This lack of taste appeal also contributes to their unpopularity as",True
27," No, the statement that Asian carp is a very fattening fish, so it is an unpopular menu item is not correct. The passage does not mention that Asian carp are particularly fattening. Instead, it notes that one species, the silver carp, can grow to be 100 pounds. The main issues with Asian carp as a food source are:

1. **Toxicity**: Asian carp consume considerable amounts of algae and plankton, some of which contains toxins. While Asian carp are resistant to these toxins, they can accumulate in the fish's tissues, making them potentially hazardous to humans.

2. **Bones**: Asian carp have a lot of tiny bones in their meat, which makes them difficult to prepare and eat. This bone structure is an unappealing characteristic for most people.

3. **Ecosystem Impact**: More crit",False
28," Yes, the statement is correct. According to the text, one species of Asian carp is the silver carp. It is mentioned that the silver carp can grow to be 100 pounds and has a tendency to jump up to ten feet in the air when frightened.",False
29," Yes, the statement is correct. Asian carp could indeed disrupt the ecosystem in Lake Michigan. Here's why:

1. **Outcompete Native Species**: Asian carp are efficient and prolific feeders. They consume large amounts of plankton and algae, which are also the primary food source for many native species in Lake Michigan. This competition for food could lead to a decline in native species populations.

2. **Alter Food Chain**: Asian carp could alter the food chain dynamics in the lake. They might outcompete native filter feeders like the quagga mussel, which play a crucial role in maintaining water quality. This could lead to an increase in nutrient levels and algal blooms.

3. **Habitat Modification**: Asian carp tend to stir up the lake bed while feeding, which can increase water turbidity. This could negatively affect plant life and fish species that rely",True
30," The statement that a waterskier is the person most threatened by silver carp in a local water source is not entirely accurate. While it is true that silver carp can pose significant threats to water skiers and other boaters due to their tendency to jump when startled by boat motors, other individuals and groups can also be adversely affected by the invasion of Asian carp.

Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Fishermen and Fish Markets**: Asian carp, particularly silver and bighead carp, can outcompete native species for food and habitat, leading to declines in native fish populations. This can impact local fishermen's livelihoods and the sustainability of fish markets.

2. **Ecosystems**: Asian carp can disrupt ecosystems by overtaking native species and altering food chains. This can have ripple effects throughout the local environment, affecting not just fish populations but also plants,",True
30," The statement that a ""beachgoer is the person who is most threatened by silver carp in a local water source"" is not entirely correct. While beachgoers can indeed be threatened by silver carp due to the fish's tendency to jump out of the water (often David when startled by boat motors), other users of the water are also at significant risk.

Here's a breakdown of who might be most threatened:

1. **Water Skiers and Boaters**: Silver carp can leap up to 10 feet in the air, making them a serious hazard to anyone in or near the water. Water skiers, boaters, and even passengers on boats can be injured by these large, flying fish.

2. **Anglers**: While silver carp are not popular for eating, they can interfere with local fishing activities. Their rapid breeding and abundant population can outcompete native fish species and",True
31," No, the statement that Silver carp can jump up to twenty feet in the air is incorrect. Silver carp are known to jump when frightened by boat motors or other disturbances, but the typical height of their jumps is around 2 to 3 feet, with exceptional jumps reaching up to 10 feet. The misconception may arise from exaggeration or misunderstanding of their impressive leaps.",False
32," Yes, the statement that Silver Carp can grow to be 100 lbs (45 kg) is correct. Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are large, fast-growing fish that are known for their rapid population growth and ability to dominate ecosystems where they are introduced. They are typically found in freshwater systems and can indeed reach sizes of over 40 kg (88 lbs), with some individuals even approaching or exceeding 100 lbs in weight. This size, combined with their tendency to jump when startled, poses a significant threat to human safety and ecosystem balance in the waters where they are invasive.",True
34," Yes, the statement that Silver carp are also known as 'flying carp' is correct. Silver carp are called 'flying carp' because of their tendency to leap out of water when startled, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet. This behavior has been well documented and is one of the most notable characteristics of this species. Their acrobatic leaps, often triggered by the sounds of boats or other disturbances, can pose a significant risk to people engaged in water activities, such as boating or fishing, as the fish can cause injuries upon impact.",True
33," Yes, the statement that Silver carp are also known as 'flying carp' is correct. Silver carp are notorious for their tendency to leap out of the water when startled, often by the sound of boat motors. They can jump up to ten feet in the air, which is why they are also referred to as 'flying carp'. This characteristic poses a significant threat to boaters and water sport enthusiasts, as collisions with these large, airborne fish can result in serious injuries.",True
35," Yes, the statement that Silver carp are also known as 'flying carp' is correct. Silver carp have a unique behavioral trait that earns them this nickname. When startled, usually by the sound of boat motors, they can jump high out of the water, sometimes reaching up to ten feet in the air. This behavior can pose a significant threat to boaters, water skiers, and other recreational water users.",True
36," Yes, the statement that silver carp have been declared an 'injurious species' by the government is correct. The U.S. Department of the Interior did indeed declare all silver carp to be an injurious species under the Lacey Act in 2007. This action was taken due to the significant threat they pose to native fish populations and aquatic ecosystems. The declaration prohibits the importation, sale, and transportation of these fish across state lines.",True
37," No, the author does not explicitly state that it would be best for the fishing industry if the canal were closed permanently. While the author mentions that some believe the Great Lakes should be cut off from the Mississippi River and legal actions have been taken to close the canal, the author's personal belief on the matter is not expressed in the given text.",True
38," No, the statement that the Great Lake states agree fully on a solution to the Asian carp problem is not correct. While there is widespread concern and cooperation among the states bordering the Great Lakes about the Asian carp invasion, there is no consensus on a single solution.

One of the main points of contention is whether to permanently close the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, which connects the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. Some states, like Michigan, support this idea, arguing that it would be the most effective way to prevent the carp from entering the lakes. However, other states, such as Illinois, oppose this idea because the canal is a crucial waterway for shipping and commercial activities.

Additionally, there are different views on how to manage and control the carp population. Some states prioritize electric barriers and other physical methods, while others advocate for targeted chemical treatments or other scientific approaches.

In summary, while there is broad",False

39," The statement that Bob got an A is not necessarily correct based on the given information. While getting the highest score in the class might suggest an A, it doesn't definitively confirm it. The highest score could still fall short of the A range. To accurately say Bob got an A, there would need to be additional information specifying the grading scale and the exact score Bob received.",False/Cannot Say
40," Yes, the statement that Bob passed the test is correct. The premise states that ""Nobody failed the test,"" which means that every student, including Bob, achieved a passing score. Since Bob got the highest score in the class, he must have received a score that is above the failing threshold, thus passing the test.",True
41," The statement that Amelia got a sister is not necessarily incorrect, but it's important to note that having a sister does not exclude the possibility of having a brother. The statement given is that Amelia does not have any brothers. Without additional information, we cannot determine whether Amelia has a sister or not. Therefore, the statement ""Amelia got a sister"" is not confirmed or denied by the information provided.",False/Cannot Say
42," The statement that Amelia has 2 sisters cannot be definitively assumed to be correct based on the given information. The information provided only states that Amelia has 2 siblings and that she does not have any brothers. It does not specify the genders of the siblings beyond stating there are no brothers. Therefore, Amelia's siblings could potentially be two sisters, but it's also possible that she has one sister and one sibling of an unspecified gender (who is not a brother). Without further information, we cannot confirm that Amelia has exactly 2 sisters.",True
43," The statement that Olly is 2 years old is correct based on the information provided in the first article. However, there is a discrepancy between the two articles regarding Olly's age. One article states that Olly is 2 years old, while the other states that Olly is 3 years old. To determine the accurate age, additional information or verification from a reliable source would be necessary.",False/Cannot Say
44," The statement that Olly is 3 years old cannot be definitively confirmed based on the information provided from the two articles. The first article says Olly is 2 years old, while the second article says Olly is 3 years old. There is a discrepancy between the two sources. To determine the correct age of Olly, more information or additional verification from reliable sources would be needed.",False/Cannot Say
45," Yes, the statement ""We cannot say how old Olly is"" is correct. The two articles provide conflicting information about Olly's age, with one stating that Olly is 2 years old and the other stating that Olly is 3 years old. Without additional information to resolve this discrepancy, it is not possible to determine Olly's exact age.",True
46," Yes, the statement is correct. If scientists have successfully developed blue apples and bright green oranges, it suggests they have the capability and knowledge to manipulate fruit colors through genetic engineering or other methods. Therefore, it is plausible that they could also create blue oranges, although the specific mention of blue oranges in the statement would need to be confirmed by additional information or a direct statement from the laboratory.",False
47," Based on the information provided, the statement that ""2000000£ pounds will be invested in the development of London transport"" is not correct. The statement says that ""Over 1000000£ will be invested,"" which means more than 1,000,000 pounds but less than 2,000,000 pounds. So, the correct statement should reflect an amount that is greater than 1,000,000 pounds but not as high as 2,000,000 pounds.",False
48," No, the statement ""We can surely say that the new medication is effective in treating cancer"" is not correct based on the information provided. The preliminary research suggests potential usefulness for treating cancer, but the results are not final, and more medical trials, especially to analyze long-term side effects, need to be conducted. The use of the word ""surely"" implies certainty, which is not present given the ongoing nature of the research. It would be more accurate to say something like, ""The preliminary research suggests that the new medication may be effective in treating cancer, but further trials are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate long-term side effects.""",False
49," No, the statement that ""We can surely say that the new medication does not have any side effects"" is not correct. Based on the details provided, the research is still in its preliminary stages, and more medical trials are needed, particularly to analyze long-term side effects. While the current results look promising, it is premature to make a definitive statement about the absence of side effects. Until comprehensive trials, including long-term studies, are completed, the potential for side effects cannot be ruled out with certainty.",False
50," No, the statement is not correct. Based on the information provided, it is not accurate to say that ""we know for sure that it has no side effects."" The preliminary research shows promising results, but the sentence ""more medical trials need to be conducted, especially to analyse long-term side effects"" indicates that the long-term side effects of the medication are still unknown. Therefore, it is premature to claim that the medication has no side effects. It is more accurate to state that while the potential effectiveness for treating cancer looks promising, the full range of possible side effects, particularly long-term ones, is not yet conclusively known.",False
51," No, the statement ""The new medication is very effective for cancer treatment, but more studies of potential side effects are needed"" is not accurate based on the information provided. The preliminary research only showed potential promise, but the results are not final. It's important to avoid overstating the efficacy of the medication until more comprehensive trials have been completed and long-term effects understood. A more accurate statement would be: ""Preliminary research suggests the new medication may be useful for cancer treatment, but more medical trials are needed to fully understand its efficacy and analyze long-term side effects.""",False
52," Based on the information provided, the statement ""There is at least one case when the new medication helped to cure cancer"" is **possibly** correct, but it's not definitively proven. The research indicates that the new medication has potential, and the current results are promising. However, the use of the phrase ""could potentially be useful"" and the mention of ongoing medical trials suggest that while there may be success stories, the medication hasn't been conclusively proven to cure cancer in all cases. The long-term side effects are also still under investigation. Therefore, while there might be at least one case where the medication helped to cure cancer, more concrete evidence is needed to confirm this for a broader patient population.",False
53," The statement you provided is a simplified version of the process, but it's not entirely accurate in the context of your preliminary research. Here's why:

1. **Animal testing is typically an early stage**: While it's likely that the new medication has been tested on animals, stating that it's now ready to be tested on humans might be jumping ahead. There are usually more phases of testing and research that happen after animal trials, such as:
   - **In vitro testing** (in cells or tissues taken from animals or humans)
   - **Phase I trials** in humans, which focus on safety and dosage.

2. **Side effects analysis might not be in humans yet**: You mentioned that more trials are needed to analyze long-term side effects. If we're talking about human trials, these would likely be Phase II or Phase III trials, dependent on the specific side effects being monitored.
",False
54," Yes, the statement that 80% of respondents reported improved sleep quality is correct. Here's why:

- 8 out of 10 respondents noticed improvement in sleep quality.
- To find the percentage, we divide the number of respondents who noticed improvement by the total number of respondents and then multiply by 100.

So, the calculation is:

\( \frac{8}{10} \times 100 = 80\% \)

Therefore, 80% of respondents reported improved sleep quality.",True
55," Yes, the statement that 80% of respondents said that they started to sleep better after using the new medication is correct. Here's the reasoning:

- 8 out of 10 respondents noticed improvement in sleep quality.
- To find the percentage, you divide the number of respondents who noticed improvement by the total number of respondents and multiply by 100:

  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of respondents who noticed improvement}}{\text{Total number of respondents}} \right) \times 100
  \]

  Plugging in the numbers:

  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100 = 80\%

Therefore, 80% of the respondents said that they",True
56," No, the statement that 60% of respondents reported improved sleep quality is not correct. According to the given information, 8 out of 10 respondents noticed an improvement in sleep quality. To find the correct percentage, you would divide the number of respondents who noticed improvement by the total number of respondents and then multiply by 100.

So the calculation would be:
\[ \frac{8}{10} \times 100 = 80\% \]

Therefore, the correct statement should be that 80% of respondents reported improved sleep quality.",True
57," No, the statement that ""every one in two respondents said that they started to sleep better after using the new medication"" is not correct based on the given information.

The correct interpretation of the given data is that 8 out of 10 respondents (or 80% of respondents) noticed an improvement in sleep quality after taking the newly developed medication. This does not translate to ""every one in two respondents"" (which would imply 50% of respondents), but rather to a significantly higher proportion.",True

59," No, the statement ""Kids do not like sweets"" is not the same as ""Kids are not into sweets."" Here's why:

1. ""Do not like"" means they actively dislike sweets.
2. ""Are not into"" means they are not interested in or enthusiastic about sweets, but it doesn't necessarily mean they dislike them.

So, while it's possible for a kid to not be into sweets without disliking them, the original statement indicates that they dislike sweets. Therefore, the statement ""Kids are not into sweets"" is not necessarily correct based on the information given.",True
60," The statement ""Eating a lot of sugar is directly related to weight gain"" is not entirely correct based on the given new studies. While it's true that excessive sugar consumption can lead to weight gain because sugary foods are often high in calories and can increase overall calorie intake, the new studies suggest that sugar intake alone may not be the sole determining factor in weight gain. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Calorie balance**: Weight gain or loss depends on energy balance – calories in versus calories out. If excess sugar calories are counterbalanced by reduced calories from other sources or increased physical activity, weight gain may not occur.

2. **Type of sugar**: Some sugars, like those found in fruits, also provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which can impact overall health and metabolism.

3. **Individual responses**: Everyone's body responds differently to sugar. Some people may be",False/Might need checking
61," Based on the information provided, it would be more accurate to say: ""The latest discoveries indicate that previous conclusions about caffeine's addictive properties may have been incorrect, suggesting that it might not be addictive.""

Using ""cannot get addicted to"" is not appropriate because:
1. It's a strong absolutist statement that may not be fully supported by the current state of research.
2. It doesn't leave room for individual variations in physiology or behavior, which could lead to different experiences with caffeine.

So, while the scientific community may have revised its understanding of caffeine and addiction, it's still best to use cautious and measured language when describing the findings.",True/Might need checking
62," The statement that ""It was recorded that at least one human had 210 bones"" is not correct based on the information provided. The statement you provided says that ""A man with 210 bones was admitted to hospital,"" which does not necessarily mean that this is the cases for all humans or that it has been recorded as a scientific fact.

The typical number of bones in an adult human body is 206. While variations in the number of bones can occur due to conditions like fusion of bones (such as the sacrum or coccyx) or the presence of extra bones (like accessory ossicles in the wrists or ankles), a total of 210 bones would be highly unusual and would require specific medical documentation and verification. Without more context or verification, the statement cannot be considered accurate.",True 
63," No, the statement that humans use only 10%-15% of their brain is not correct according to modern neuroscience. This is a persistent myth, but it has been debunked by numerous studies and neuroimaging techniques.

Research has shown that all areas of the brain are active, even when we're resting or sleeping. Different brain regions are responsible for various functions, and they all contribute to our overall cognition, behavior, and body functions. Here are a few key points:

1. **Imaging Studies**: Modern imaging techniques like PET, fMRI, and MEG show that there is no dormant or unused area in the brain. Different tasks engage different parts of the brain, but no region is consistently ""unused.""

2. **Energy Consumption**: The brain consumes a significant portion of the body's energy resources, which wouldn't be the case if large parts of it were",False
65," No, the statement that goldfish have a 3-second memory is not correct. This myth likely originates from a study conducted in the 1990s by psychologist Dr. Benjamin Hart and his colleagues. In that study, goldfish were trained to perform a task that involved pressing a lever to receive food. When the interval between the lever press and the food delivery was increased, the goldfish stopped performing the task after about 3 seconds. However, this only demonstrated the goldfish's ability to associate a cause and effect within a short time frame, not their overall memory capacity.

Subsequent research has shown that goldfish can remember information for much longer periods, sometimes several days or even months. They have been shown to remember how to navigate mazes, recognize other fish, and even remember different colors and shapes over extended periods. Therefore, the 3-second memory myth is not an accurate representation of goldfish memory capabilities.",False
66," The statement that bulls are irritated by the red color is a common myth, but it is not accurate in most cases. Bulls are colorblind to red, and they likely do not perceive red as different from other colors. Instead, bulls react to movement and changes in their environment. In bullfighting, for instance, the matador's cape (muleta) is red to disguise blood stains, not because bulls are angered by the color red. Similarly, in cattle ranching, the red color on a cattle handler's flags or clothing is used for visibility rather than provocation. Therefore, the statement that bulls are irritated by the red color is not correct.",False
67," The statement that Vikings wore horned helmets is not correct. The misconception likely arises from the helmets used in Wagner's 19th-century operatic productions, which included horns to evoke a pagan, Norse aesthetic. However, no archaeological or historical evidence supports the widespread use of horned helmets among Vikings during their time (8th–11th centuries). Vikings are known to have worn helmets, but these were likely made of iron or steel and were generally conical or rounded, without horns.",False
68," Yes, the traditional understanding is that humans have five primary senses: taste, hearing, sight, smell, and touch. The statement you provided is widely accepted as correct according to this traditional model.

However, as you mentioned, there is also broad consensus among scientists that humans have other sensory capabilities beyond the traditional five. These include:

1. **Proprioception**: The sense of one's own body position and movements.
2. **Vestibular (Balance)**: The sense that helps us maintain balance and spatial orientation.
3. **Nociception**: The sense of pain.
4. **Thermoception**: The sense of heat and cold.

Including these additional senses, some scientists argue that humans have around 20 or more senses. So while the traditional classification includes five primary senses, the actual picture is more complex and includes many more sensory modalities.",False
69," Yes, the statement is correct. Hair, nails, and skin do not continue to grow after death. The process of growth stops immediately once a person dies, as any growth processes in the body require energy and cellular activity, which cease upon death.

The misconception may arise because the skin surrounding hair and nails can recede, shrink, or dehydrate after death, making the hair and nails appear longer. This is a post-mortem change and not actual growth. Similarly, other tissues in the body may dehydrate and retract, which can make certain features appear more prominent.

In summary, there is no active growth of hair, nails, or skin after death. The perceived changes are due to post-mortem processes in the tissues.",True 
70," Yes, the statement that ""the receptors for different tastes are spread across the tongue"" is correct. The assumption that the tongue has specific taste zones (such as sweet at the tip, salty at the sides, sour at the back, and bitter toward the throat) is indeed false. Research has shown that taste buds capable of detecting all five basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami) are distributed throughout the tongue and the entire mouth, including the soft palate, upper esophagus, and epiglottis.

Each taste bud contains multiple receptor cells, and these cells are capable of responding to various taste stimuli, making the taste zones theory obsolete. This misconception likely arose from the early work of German scientist David P. Hanig, whose findings were misinterpreted and popularized in the early 20th century.",True
71," The statement ""Lightning never strikes the same place twice"" is not accurate. Lightning can and does strike the same place multiple times. Especially for tall, pointed, or isolated structures like the Empire State Building, which act as a lightning rod, multiple strikes in a single location are not uncommon.

In the case of the Empire State Building, it is actually struck by lightning numerous times each year. The building is protected by a sophisticated lightning protection system that safely channels the electrical charge to the ground, preventing damage. Therefore, while the myth persists, scientific evidence and observations show that lightning can indeed strike the same place multiple times.",False

73," No, the statement that John enjoys eating spicy food is not correct. Since John dislikes spicy food, it means he does not enjoy eating it.",False
74," The statement ""Anna completed her studies last year"" is not necessarily correct. Graduating and completing one's studies are related but not identical terms. Graduating typically involves participating in a formal ceremony and receiving a diploma or degree. In contrast, completing one's studies typically refers to the act of having finished all required coursework and academic requirements. If Anna graduated last year, it implies she likely completed her studies. However, if the focus is on the completion of studies specifically, the statement would need clearer context to be considered accurate.",True
75," No, the statement ""The sky was cloudy this morning"" is not correct. The original statement states that ""The sky was clear this morning,"" so the opposite would be ""The sky was not clear this morning,"" which could mean the sky was cloudy, but it could also mean it was partly cloudy. Therefore, we cannot definitively say ""The sky was cloudy this morning"" based on the original statement.",False
76," Yes, the statement ""Tom drives a red vehicle"" is correct. The phrase ""a red vehicle"" is a broader term that includes cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other types of vehicles.

84," Yes, the statement ""This book came out in 2020"" is correct. ""Came out"" is a phrasal verb that means ""was published"" or ""was released,"" so it can be used interchangeably with ""was published"" in this context.

90," Yes, the statement ""The performance begins at 8 PM"" is correct if ""The concert starts at 8 PM"" means the same thing.

94," To determine if the statement ""Alice traveled to the Grand Canyon in the summer"" is correct, we need to look more closely at the original statement: ""Alice visited the Grand Canyon last summer.""

The phrase ""last summer"" means the summer that just passed before the current one. If the current date is within the summer, ""last summer"" refers to the summer before the current one, which is the same summer described in the statement ""Alice traveled to the Grand Canyon in the summer.""

Therefore, both statements refer to the same time period, making the second statement correct. Alice indeed traveled to the Grand Canyon in the summer.",True
95," The statement that Paul left his umbrella behind at home is not entirely accurate. The correct statement would be that Paul forgot his umbrella at home or that Paul's umbrella is still at home. Leaving something behind implies a conscious action, whereas forgetting does not. So, it's better to say he forgot it rather than he left it behind.",True
96," No, the statement ""My phone battery needs charging every hour"" is not correct. According to the given statement ""My phone battery lasts all day,"" it implies that the battery can last for the entire day without needing to be recharged.
