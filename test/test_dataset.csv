16,"Malala was born on 12 th July 1997 and she was raised in Swat
Valley in North Pakistan. During her early childhood, Malala’s
hometown of Mingora was a tourist hotspot and held many
festivals. Her parents aptly named Malala after Malala of the
Maiwand (a courageous woman who helped to protect her village
from invasion over 100 years before).","Mingora was a popular among tourists","True"
17,"Malala has two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, and her parents were determined
to ensure that she, unlike many of her peers, was afforded the same education and
opportunities as them. Malala loved school yet, at the time in Pakistan, all schools for girls
were being ordered to close: Malala was unable to go to school as her brothers had.
Malala began to write an anonymous blog about her
experience of the unequal treatment of girls in Pakistan:
a risky topic for a young girl to speak about at the
time. To protect her identity, she wrote using the name,
Gul Makai. Having just given her first speech on rights
to education, Malala no longer wanted to hide her
identity. Her blog became very popular and she was
even interviewed for a documentary. As her popularity
grew, she went on to win several peace awards and she
attended a lot of prestigious events","Malala wrote a book anonymously when she was 11 years old","False"
18,"Some people did not agree with what Malala had to say; they did not want her views to
become well known. Due to this, Malala was injured as she travelled on a bus home from
school. She was flown to Birmingham, UK, to treat the wounds that she had suffered. Despite
being very ill, Malala made a miraculous recovery and was released from hospital less than
three months later.
Messages of sympathy and support for Malala flooded in from around the world, with a host
of celebrities and famous politicians offering messages of support. The President of Pakistan,
Asif Ali Zardari, created an education fund in honour of Malala.
Continuing Activism
Malala was determined to continue her activism in
support of the right to education for all. Only nine
months after her injury, Malala took to the stage at the
United Nations (the organisation which aims to ensure
world peace and security) on her 16th birthday. She
stated clearly that nothing had changed and that she
had more strength, power and courage than ever. “My
dreams are the same,” she bravely stated. The United
Nations named the day, ‘Malala Day’.
Regardless of the views of others, Malala continues to
campaign for equal rights in education. At the age of 17,
she was the youngest person in the world to receive the
Nobel Peace Prize: a prestigious award given annually
to people who do outstanding work to contribute to
world peace.
Malala currently lives in England and is studying
for a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at
university. Malala considers Benazir Bhutto, the first
female president of Pakistan, to be her role model. She
says her dream is to be a politician: a job where she can
help to make a difference. With the help of her father,
Malala has started a charity called The Malala Fund,
which aims to support girls from around the world to be
able to learn and lead.","Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17 years old","True"

Education was highly regarded in Malala’s family and her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai (a
poet and the principal of a girls’ school) was a firm believer in equal rights for boys and
girls. Malala calls her mother, Toor Pekai Yousafzai, ‘brave and courageous’ for supporting
her husband’s dreams and ambitions, as well as taking care of the family and their home.

20,"In the splendid palace of the Emerald City, which is in the
center of the fairy Land of Oz, is a great Throne Room. This
is where Princess Ozma, the Ruler, sits in a throne of
glistening emeralds for an hour each day and listens to all the
troubles of her people, which they are sure to tell her about.
Around Ozma's throne, on such occasions, are grouped all
the important personages1 of Oz, such as the Scarecrow,
Tiktok the Clockwork Man, the Tin Woodman, the Wizard
of Oz, and other famous fairy people. Little Dorothy usually
has a seat at Ozma's feet, and crouched on either side the
throne are two enormous beasts known as the Hungry Tiger
and the Cowardly Lion.
These two beasts are Ozma's chief guardians, but as
everyone loves the beautiful girl Princess there has never
been any disturbance in the great Throne Room, or anything
for the guardians to do but look fierce and solemn2 and keep
quiet until the Royal Audience is over and the people go
away to their homes.
Of course no one would dare be naughty while the huge Lion
and Tiger crouched beside the throne; but the fact is, the
people of Oz are very seldom naughty. So Ozma's big guards
are more ornamental3 than useful. No one realizes that
better than the beasts themselves.
One day, after everyone had left the Throne Room except the
Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the Lion yawned and
said to his friend:
'I'm getting tired of this job. No one is afraid of us and no
one pays any attention to us.'
'That is true,' replied the big Tiger, purring softly. 'We
might as well be in the thick jungles where we were born, as
trying to protect Ozma when she needs no protection. And
I'm dreadfully hungry all the time.'","Lion and the Tiger bored at the beginning 
of the story because nobody acts bad around the Lion and the Tiger.","True"

I'm dreadfully hungry all the time.'
'You have enough to eat, I'm sure,' said the Lion, swaying
his tail slowly back and forth.
'Enough, perhaps; but not the kind of food I long for,'
answered the Tiger. 'What I'm hungry for is fat babies. I
have a great desire to eat a few fat babies. Then, perhaps, the
people of Oz would fear me and I'd become more
important.'
'True,' agreed the Lion. 'It would stir up quite a scene if you
ate but one fat baby. As for myself, my claws are sharp as
needles and strong as crowbars. My teeth are powerful
enough to tear a person to pieces in a few seconds. I could
spring upon a man and make chop suey of him. There would
be wild excitement in the Emerald City. People would fall
upon their knees and beg me for mercy. That, in my opinion,
would render me very important.'
'After you had torn the person to pieces, what would you do
next?' asked the Tiger sleepily.
'Then I would roar so loudly it would shake the earth and
stalk away to the jungle to hide myself, before anyone could
attack me or kill me for what I had done.'
'I see,' nodded the Tiger. 'You are really cowardly.'
'To be sure. That is why I am named the Cowardly Lion.
That is why I have always been so tame and peaceable. But
I'm awfully tired of being tame,' added the Lion, with a sigh,
'and it would be fun to raise a row and show people what a
terrible beast I really am.'
The Tiger remained silent for several minutes, thinking
deeply as he slowly washed his face with his left paw. Then
he said:
'I'm getting old, and it would please me to eat at least one fat
baby before I die. Suppose we surprise these people of Oz
and prove our power. What do you say? We will walk out of
here just as usual and the first baby we meet I'll eat in a
jiffy4. And the first man or woman you meet, you will tear to
pieces. Then we will both run out of the city gates and gallop
across the country and hide in the jungle before anyone can
stop us.'
'All right. I'm game,' said the Lion, yawning again so that
he showed two rows of large sharp teeth.
The Tiger got up and stretched his great, sleek body.","The Lion and 
the Tiger made their plan because they need to be fed more food.","False"
23,"Timid and weeping, the boy had attended his mother's
funeral; gloomy and shy, he had listened to Siddhartha, who
greeted him as his son and welcomed him at his place in
Vasudeva's hut. Pale, he sat for many days by the hill of the
dead, did not want to eat, gave no open look, did not open his
heart, met his fate with resistance and denial.
Siddhartha spared him and let him do as he pleased, he
honoured his mourning. Siddhartha understood that his son
did not know him, that he could not love him like a father.
Slowly, he also saw and understood that the eleven-year-old
was a pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he had grown
up in the habits of rich people, accustomed to finer food, to a
soft bed, accustomed to giving orders to servants. Siddhartha
understood that the mourning, pampered child could not
suddenly and willingly be content with a life among
strangers and in poverty. He did not force him, he did many a
chore for him, always picked the best piece of the meal for
him. Slowly, he hoped to win him over, by friendly patience.
Rich and happy, he had called himself, when the boy had
come to him. Since time had passed on in the meantime, and
the boy remained a stranger and in a gloomy disposition1,
since he displayed a proud and stubbornly disobedient heart,
did not want to do any work, did not pay his respect to the
old men, stole from Vasudeva's fruit-trees, then Siddhartha
began to understand that his son had not brought him
happiness and peace, but suffering and worry. But he loved
him, and he preferred the suffering and worries of love over
happiness and joy without the boy. Since young Siddhartha
was in the hut, the old men had split the work. Vasudeva had
again taken on the job of the ferryman2 all by himself, and
Siddhartha, in order to be with his son, did the work in the
hut and the field.
For a long time, for long months, Siddhartha waited for his
son to understand him, to accept his love, to perhaps
reciprocate3 it. For long months, Vasudeva waited,
watching, waited and said nothing. One day, when
Siddhartha the younger had once again tormented his father
very much with spite and an unsteadiness in his wishes and
had broken both of his rice-bowls, Vasudeva took his friend
aside in the evening and talked to him.","Siddhartha has raised

26,"The United States has a lengthy history of going to
war. It is a nation born from war. Pick any year since
1776, and the odds of America being involved in at
least one war is over 90%. Every US President has
faced war. Still, it may surprise you to hear that the US
government is at war with a fish.
Asian carp were introduced to American waters during
the 1970s. Southern fish farmers began importing them
to help clean their ponds. Asian carp are phenomenal
cleaners. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long for them
to escape from these ponds, perhaps from flooding, and
get into the Mississippi River. From there they have
followed their natural tendency to swim upstream. This
tendency may lead them into the Great Lakes and
Canada, a nightmare scenario for fisherman.
Asian carp are large fish. One species, the silver carp,
can grow to be 100 pounds. But despite their size, they
feed from the bottom of the food chain. That means
that they eat plankton and algae. A one hundred pound
fish can eat an awful lot of sea scum, and some of it is
toxic. The carp are resistant to the toxins, but we aren't.
Some Asian carp are hazardous to eat because they
have so many algal toxins in their systems. They also
have lots of tiny bones in their meat, which makes
them difficult to prepare. Asian carp is not a popular
delicacy.
Introducing the Asian carp into waters that have not
known them can be devastating. Beneath the surface of
the water is a unique ecosystem. This system rests
delicately on a balance that has evolved over millions
of years. Then along come these big, hungry bottom
feeders to mess up everything. They breed rapidly and
densely populate the waters. Worse still, they compete
with the native bottom feeders. The native bottom
feeders are smaller. Larger, tastier fish like salmon eat
them. The native bottom feeders are an important part
of the ecosystem. When the Asian carp outperform
them, the whole food chain suffers, all the way up to
the people.
Not only do Asian carp mess up the food chain, they
mess up people. Seriously. An Asian carp will bust you
in head. Remember that silver carp can be 100 pounds.
There is a reason why they are also known as 'flying
carp.' This particular species of Asian carp has a
tendency to jump when frightened. They can jump up
to ten feet in the air, and the sound of boat motors
frightens them. Watch out watersportists! In 2003 a
woman jetskier collided with one and broke her nose
and a vertebra. She almost drowned. In 2008 a teenager
broke his jaw on one while tubing. Many others have
been injured by these flying logs. Asian carp pose a
serious threat to water skiers and boaters.
In 2007 the U.S. Department of the Interior declared all
silver carp to be an injurious species. In 2010, the State
of Michigan passed the $30 million CARPACT. In
2012 Congress approved the 'Stop Invasive Species'
act, legislation written solely to protect the Great Lakes
from Asian carp. The government has been on the
offensive against these large-bellied invaders.
But Asian carp are difficult to catch. Since they eat
from the bottom, they do not go for lures or baits like
most large fish. The best way to stop them is to keep
them out. The Great Lakes are connected to the
Mississippi River through the 28-mile Chicago
Sanitary and Ship Canal. For Chicagoans, it is the final
point of resistance.
A series of multimillion-dollar electrical barriers have
been built along the canal. The barriers are effective at
keeping adult carp at bay, but some fear that baby carp
may pass through. The United States Army Corps of
Engineers has been deployed along with EPA. In 2009
they poisoned the entire canal with rotenone, a
chemical that kills fish. The $3 million operation netted
over 90 tons of dead fish, and a single carp.
Some think that Great Lakes must be cut off from the
Mississippi River. The Michigan Attorney General
sued to have the canal closed. The Ontario government
and some Great Lake states have also taken legal
action. But the courts have been persuaded by the value
of the canal as a shipping conduit thus far. In the
meantime, the barriers continue to hold, but how long
can they? The carp have the Great Lakes under siege. Is
this a war that we are destined to lose?","Asian carp is an unpopular 
menu item since it is hard to prepare because of all the little bones","True"

have lots of tiny bones in their meat, which makes
them difficult to prepare. Asian carp is not a popular
delicacy.
Introducing the Asian carp into waters that have not
known them can be devastating. Beneath the surface of
the water is a unique ecosystem. This system rests
delicately on a balance that has evolved over millions
of years. Then along come these big, hungry bottom
feeders to mess up everything. They breed rapidly and
densely populate the waters. Worse still, they compete
with the native bottom feeders. The native bottom
feeders are smaller. Larger, tastier fish like salmon eat
them. The native bottom feeders are an important part
of the ecosystem. When the Asian carp outperform
them, the whole food chain suffers, all the way up to
the people.
Not only do Asian carp mess up the food chain, they
mess up people. Seriously. An Asian carp will bust you
in head. Remember that silver carp can be 100 pounds.
There is a reason why they are also known as 'flying
carp.' This particular species of Asian carp has a
tendency to jump when frightened. They can jump up
to ten feet in the air, and the sound of boat motors
frightens them. Watch out watersportists! In 2003 a
woman jetskier collided with one and broke her nose
and a vertebra. She almost drowned. In 2008 a teenager
broke his jaw on one while tubing. Many others have
been injured by these flying logs. Asian carp pose a
serious threat to water skiers and boaters.
In 2007 the U.S. Department of the Interior declared all
silver carp to be an injurious species. In 2010, the State
of Michigan passed the $30 million CARPACT. In
2012 Congress approved the 'Stop Invasive Species'
act, legislation written solely to protect the Great Lakes
from Asian carp. The government has been on the
offensive against these large-bellied invaders.
But Asian carp are difficult to catch. Since they eat
from the bottom, they do not go for lures or baits like
most large fish. The best way to stop them is to keep
them out. The Great Lakes are connected to the
Mississippi River through the 28-mile Chicago
Sanitary and Ship Canal. For Chicagoans, it is the final
point of resistance.
A series of multimillion-dollar electrical barriers have
been built along the canal. The barriers are effective at
keeping adult carp at bay, but some fear that baby carp
may pass through. The United States Army Corps of
Engineers has been deployed along with EPA. In 2009
they poisoned the entire canal with rotenone, a
chemical that kills fish. The $3 million operation netted
over 90 tons of dead fish, and a single carp.
Some think that Great Lakes must be cut off from the
Mississippi River. The Michigan Attorney General
sued to have the canal closed. The Ontario government
and some Great Lake states have also taken legal
action. But the courts have been persuaded by the value
of the canal as a shipping conduit thus far. In the

can they? The carp have the Great Lakes under siege. Is

Asian carp were introduced to American waters during
the 1970s. Southern fish farmers began importing them
to help clean their ponds. Asian carp are phenomenal
cleaners. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long for them
to escape from these ponds, perhaps from flooding, and
get into the Mississippi River. From there they have
followed their natural tendency to swim upstream. This
tendency may lead them into the Great Lakes and
Canada, a nightmare scenario for fisherman.
Asian carp are large fish. One species, the silver carp,
can grow to be 100 pounds. But despite their size, they
feed from the bottom of the food chain. That means
that they eat plankton and algae. A one hundred pound
fish can eat an awful lot of sea scum, and some of it is
toxic. The carp are resistant to the toxins, but we aren't.
Some Asian carp are hazardous to eat because they
have so many algal toxins in their systems. They also
have lots of tiny bones in their meat, which makes
them difficult to prepare. Asian carp is not a popular
delicacy.
Introducing the Asian carp into waters that have not
known them can be devastating. Beneath the surface of
the water is a unique ecosystem. This system rests
delicately on a balance that has evolved over millions
of years. Then along come these big, hungry bottom
feeders to mess up everything. They breed rapidly and
densely populate the waters. Worse still, they compete
with the native bottom feeders. The native bottom
feeders are smaller. Larger, tastier fish like salmon eat
them. The native bottom feeders are an important part
of the ecosystem. When the Asian carp outperform
them, the whole food chain suffers, all the way up to
the people.
Not only do Asian carp mess up the food chain, they
mess up people. Seriously. An Asian carp will bust you
in head. Remember that silver carp can be 100 pounds.
There is a reason why they are also known as 'flying
carp.' This particular species of Asian carp has a
tendency to jump when frightened. They can jump up
to ten feet in the air, and the sound of boat motors
frightens them. Watch out watersportists! In 2003 a
woman jetskier collided with one and broke her nose
and a vertebra. She almost drowned. In 2008 a teenager
broke his jaw on one while tubing. Many others have
